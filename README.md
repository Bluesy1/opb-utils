## OPB utils

This is my system for creating questions for OPB stats.

Includes creating issues with `python create_issues.py`, a TUI for creating questions with `python tui.py`, and auto generating questions from openintro-statistics with `python issues_to_questions.py`. Also includes bash scripts for pushing a question from here to `instructor_stats_bank` and creating PRs.

See [TUI.md](./TUI.md) for more information on the TUI.
See [AUTO.md](./AUTO.md) for more information on openintro-statistics auto generation.
